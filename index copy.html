        <p>We'll be tying the knot at the best brunch restaurant in town,
          <a href="http://www.sqwires.com">Sqwires Restaurant and Annex</a>
          in Lafayette Square, St. Louis, MO.
        <p>In addition to serving extra-delicious nummies, Sqwires is known
          for their extravagant Bloody Mary bar and industrial-inspired,
          rustic decor.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>SqWires is a handsome redesign of a 19th century brick structure,
          part of a Victorian-era factory complex. The former Western Wire
          manufacturing buildings, located on an entire city block in historic
          Lafayette Square originally housed the American Bed Factory. In 2001
          the complex was totally renovated and converted to house SqWires
          Restaurant plus 80 business and residential lofts.
        <p>Lafayette Square is St. Louis' oldest historic district. Nearly
          400 Victorian era homes have been restored on the streets
          surrounding the stunning 30-acre Lafayette Park&mdash;the oldest park
          west of the Mississippi. In the late 19th century, Lafayette Square
          was St. Louis' premier neighborhood; home to Lincoln's Postmaster
          General, St. Louis Mayors, captains of industry, and the city's
          leading families.

        <p>We are not <a href="https://youtu.be/O-zpOMYRi0w">so fancy</a>
          &mdash; let's try to keep things <i>business casual</i>. If you're
          feeling particularly festive, you could always try to match our
          wedding colors (burnt-orange and navy-blue), but don't hurt yourself.
        <p>Neither of the grooms will be wearing white, so if you
          have an old wedding dress that needs some action, you should
          absolutely feel free to leave it at home and wear something
          normal, please.
